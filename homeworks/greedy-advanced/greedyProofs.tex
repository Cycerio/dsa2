\question[2]{
You are given a set of points $P=\{ p_1, p_2, ... , p_n \}$ on the real line (you may assume these are given to you in sorted order). Describe an algorithm that determines the smallest set of unit-length closed intervals that contains all of the given points. For example, the points $\{ 0.9, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 3.0 \}$ can be covered by $[ 0.7, 1.7 ]$ and $[ 2.0, 3.0 ]$. State the runtime of your algorithm.
}

\answer[0 in]{
Greedy. Start with smallest point $p_1$ and place an interval at $[p_1,p_1+1]$. Go to the next $p_i>p_1+1$ and repeat until done.
}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------


\question[3]{
Prove that your algorithm always returns the optimal result.
}

\answer[0 in]{
Look at the pdf on collab resources. Proof is almost exact same as interval scheduling, so I'll paraphrase here.\\
\\
First prove a lemma showing the every greedy interval MUST have a higher (or equal) starting value compared to the corresponding interval in an arbitrary optimal solution. We are proving that $\forall_{i\geq1}g_i \geq o_i$. This is pretty easily shown by induction. The inductive step essentially argues that if somehow $o_k$ is now ending strictly later than the greedy, then the greedy must have chosen an interval further left than it needed to because $o_k$ definitely works with the greedy solution (or the greedy must have missed a point, meaning it isn't a correct algorithm). \\
\\
You then use this result to show that if somehow the optimal is better than greedy, a similar thing must have happened. Greedy had more intervals but they are all completely to the right of the entire optimal solution, which makes no sense.

\question[2]{
Consider a situation in which you have $n$ skiers with heights $p_1,p_2,...,p_n$, and $n$ pairs of skis with length $s_1,s_2,...,s_n$. The problem is to assign each person a pair of skis so that the overall difference between the height of a skier and the length of their skis is minimized. More precisely, if $\alpha(i)$ returns the index of the skis assigned to person $p_i$, we want to minimize:

\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(|p_i - s_{\alpha(i)}|)
\end{align*}

Consider two greedy algorithms that may solve this problem:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the skier and skis whose height difference is minimized. Assign those skis to that skier and repeat.
\item Pair the smallest skier with the smallest skis, second smallest skier to second shortest skis, etc. until all pairings are complete.
\end{enumerate}

One of these greedy algorithms is correct. You must do three things: Prove this problem has optimal substructure. Claim which of the two algorithms is correct. Then show the greedy choice property of your chosen algorithm by using an exchange argument.

\question[3]{
Let's suppose we want to replicate a single file $f$ over a collection of $n$ servers $S_1,S_2,...,S_n$. Each server has a cost of storing the file. Let $c_i$ be the cost of storing $f$ on server $i$. Let's also stipulate that $c_n=0$ (to guarantee that the file can be stored on at least one server for free).\\
\\
Your problem is to figure what subset of the $n$ servers you should store the file on in order to minimize cost (which we define in more detail now). Suppose the file is stored on a subset of server indices $L \subseteq [1,n]$ and that $n \in L$ ($L$ cannot be empty). More formally, file $f$ is on server $i$ iff $i \in L$. When a user tries to access the file they start from some server $S_j$, and they attempt to access $S_j$, then $S_{j+1}$ etc until they find the file (they will always find $f$ on $S_n$ in the worst case). We say this costs the user:

\begin{align*}
u_j = \left( \min\limits_{k \geq j : k \in L} k \right) - j
\end{align*}

For any particular set $L \subseteq [1,n]$, the total cost is thus:

\begin{align*}
cost(L) = \sum\limits_{i \in L} c_i + \sum\limits_{j \in [1,n]} u_j
\end{align*}

First, provide a brute-force algorithm that solves this problem. What is the run-time and why? Then, provide a better algorithm that solves this problem.
}

\answer[0.25 in]{
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Brute Force Algorithm:} Iterate over each subset of $[1, n]$ 
    and compute the cost for each, preserving the minimum.

    \item \textbf{Brute Force Analysis:}
    For each subset $L\subseteq {1, \ldots, n}$: 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Given $L$ and $j$, computing $u_j$ is a $\Theta(n)$ operation 
      (as the $\operatorname{min}$ operation may iterate over all elements of 
      $L$, which has a maximum size $n$.  

      \item Thus, the cost for a given subset may be computed naively in 
      $\Theta(n^2)$ (as we are summing a linear operation $n$ times).
    \end{itemize}

    Therefore, the runtime for a ``brute force'' approach to computing the 
    minimum cost is $\Theta(n^2 2^n)$.

    \item \textbf{Better Algorithm:}
    The trick here is that we ``walk backwards'' through the servers, deciding 
    at each step whether or not to store the file on that server.  If we are 
    on the $k$th server, we compare $c_k$ (cost of getting immediately to the 
    file) and $\ell - k$, where $\ell$ is the index of the most recent server 
    where you stored the file. 

    In plain language, at each step we either spend $c_k$ to get immediately to
    the file, or we spend $\ell-k$ travel to the $\ell$th server where you 
    stored the file last time.

    This actually runs in $\Theta(n)$ time, as we only perform one pass through
    the input.
  \end{enumerate}
